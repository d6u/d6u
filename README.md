# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I make apps and websites. Some âœ¨ stuff âœ¨ I made:**

### ðŸ’¬ [promptplay.xyz](https://promptplay.xyz) ([Repo](https://github.com/d6u/PromptPlay))

_A React library that implements the CSS container query concept, to achieve better CSS modularity for different element sizes. This is dependended by thousands of repos and hundreds of packages._ 

_Disclaimer: I made the library around 2015 and 2017. Then it was moved to be maintained by [a set of wonderful people](https://github.com/react-container-query/react-container-query/graphs/contributors)._

### ðŸ“ž [VideoChatRoom](https://gameroom-beta.daiwei.lu) ([Repo](https://github.com/d6u/VideoChatRoom))
