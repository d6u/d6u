# Hi there üëã

**I make apps and libraries. Some ‚ú® stuff ‚ú® I made:**

### üí¨ [RelierStudio](https://relier.ai) ([repo]([https://github.com/d6u/PromptPlay](https://github.com/d6u/RelierStudio)))

_An agent workflow engine._

Tech:
- TypeScript, React, RxJS, Jotai, GraphQL, Emotion, Node.js, Electron
- AWS CloudFormation, AWS CloudFront, AWS S3

### ü´ô react-container-query ([repo](https://github.com/react-container-query/react-container-query))

_Demo: http://react-container-query.github.io/react-container-query/_

_A React library that implements the CSS container query concept, to achieve better CSS modularity for different element sizes. This is dependended by [thousands of repos and hundreds of packages](https://github.com/react-container-query/react-container-query/network/dependents) with 800+ ‚≠êÔ∏è._ 

_Disclaimer: I made the library around 2015 and 2017. Then it was moved to be maintained by [a set of wonderful people](https://github.com/react-container-query/react-container-query/graphs/contributors)._

### üìû [VideoChatRoom](https://gameroom-beta.daiwei.lu) ([repo](https://github.com/d6u/VideoChatRoom))

_WebRTC video chat with friends using links. No registration required. (Won't work with NAT.)_

Tech:
- Frontend: TypeScript, React, RxJS, WebSocket, WebRTC
- Backend: TypeScript, Node.js
- Deploy: AWS CloudFormation, AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda, AWS CloudFront, AWS S3, AWS DynamoDB, AWS SQS

---

**I also made a bunch of other üß™ experimental / prototypy projects üß™:**

_Almost all of these are experimental, and no longer functional due to lack of maintenance. But I still hope you can find some inspiration._
